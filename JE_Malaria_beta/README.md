# Shiny Malaria Interactive Map beta

## Summary
This project is to create an interactive map that illustrates the distribution of Malaria research sites with their predicted treatment failure and their samples size at each site. **However, instead of being like alpha version, this beta version will color research sites based on their geographical characteristics. And it also support the piechart option**. This application should be run on Google Chrome to have the best experience. There is a small issue if you are using Google Chrome when exporting PDF. After exporting there will be a blank screen, you need to click the button **_Export to PDF_** again, then cancel and it will appear as normal screen.
